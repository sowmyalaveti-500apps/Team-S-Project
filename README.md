**Description:** We used Python as backend to get data from resume PDF. After gettng the data we will save it as json and use REST calls to send data to frontend. Presently we used static data of resume parser in UI. We are taking fields of company name, college name, degree, designation, email, experience, skills, name and total years of experience.
